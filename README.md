# CS50

These are my programming examples for CS50x, a computer science course offered by Harvard University.

## Week 1
* **hello.c** - simple "hello, world" program
* **ask.c** - one step further, prompts for name then says "hello, $name"
* **loop.c** - prints numbers 1 - 49
* **water.c** - finds bottles of water used in *x* minutes in the shower
