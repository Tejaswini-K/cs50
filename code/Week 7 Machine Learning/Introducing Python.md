# Introducing Python


```python
x = 3
y = 5
x + y
```




    8




```python
x = 'a'
y = ' b'
x + y
```




    'a b'



No need for declarations! No difference between chars and strings! No compiling! We can read it too.


```python
for i in [3, 5, 7]:
    print(i)
```

    3
    5
    7


There are some syntax differences. There are no curly brackets, indentation is important. The for loop is more like a for each loop.


```python
if 3 != 5:
    print("Indeed")
```

    Indeed



```python

```
